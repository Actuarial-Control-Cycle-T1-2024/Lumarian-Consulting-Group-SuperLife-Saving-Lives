# Project Flow / Case Story

### Stage 1: Understand Project Summary
To start off, it was essential for our team, LCG, to understand the requirements and project details put forward by SuperLife to construct a health incentive program. This understanding drove effective consultation concerning SuperLife's primary goals and objectives.
### Stage 2: Data Investigation and External Research
The next stage of our project flow focused on understanding the data provided by SuperLife and filling in the gaps of the internal data with our external research. Our internal research focused on mortality experience, customer demographics and other insights discussed in the report. Our external research focused mainly on the efficacy and costs of the intervention programs and incentive recommendations.
### Stage 3: Intervention and Incentive Selection
Utilising our external research and growth opportunities determined through our understanding of the demographics, we determined the main intervention programs and incentive selections that would provide the greatest health benefits and economic values for Superlife and Lumaria. Resulting in the intervention program choices of smoking cessation, general health screening and healthy heart screening, suitable insurance types and incentives were determined to maximise a decrease in expected mortality and an increase in program participation.
### Stage 4: Establish Data Assumptions and Limitations
Before beginning the pricing, it was important to determine the data assumptions and limitations associated with our pricing model as well as the overall insights to maximise transparency and accuracy. There were a range of key assumptions made by our team, including data assumptions, program design assumptions, pricing and cost assumptions, lapse rate assumptions, reserves assumptions, mortality assumptions, market rate assumptions, and other miscellaneous assumptions. Similarly, data limitations covered the intervention program, internal and external data, and economic data.
### Stage 5: Pricing - Profits and Scenario Analysis
This stage adjusted the template pricing model to reflect our limitations and intervention incentives found from internal and external research. Macros was formulated to provide results for all age groups and policy types which was leveraged for a stronger sensitivity analysis. Our model found that pricing and costs covered the mortality savings if our policy bundles were implemented over the past 20 years. It also projects the expected economic value added over suitable timeframes such as 20, 40 and 60-year for whole life and 20-year for our term life products. We also determine possible pricing adjustments, focusing mainly on premium reductions.
### Stage 6: Risk and Risk Mitigations
Combining ongoing risk identification and categorising these under RCD guide, we outlined key mitigation approaches against selected risks for company consideration. Several considerable risks were considered for SuperLife's incentive program in a constructed risk matrix including intervention parameter errors, rate fluctuation, moral hazard and regional disparity. A sensitivity analysis on pricing parameters, interest rate and variable expenses showed that our three programs are mostly profitable, with threats only on the extremities of our analysis. 
### Stage 7: Final Recommendations
This constructed the rationale for our product solution for SuperLife from the synthesis of prior components.

# Project Summary
Lumarian Consulting Group (LCG) presents a set of proposed life insurance and health incentive programs tailored for SuperLife's policyholders. These programs leverage data-driven insights and ethical considerations to incentivize healthy behaviours, reduce mortality rates, boost life insurance sales, enhance product competitiveness, and drive economic value for SuperLife.
Our proposal provides distinct life insurance offerings for a wide range of policyholders. For our 20-year term (T20) product, we introduce a smoking cessation program for eligible smokers under the age of 40, as well as, a general health screening intervention for eligible non-smokers under the age of 45. These programs have the incentive of reduced premiums upon engagement with the intervention. For our whole life (WL) product, we introduce a healthy heart screening intervention for eligible non-smokers over 45 with the incentive of a cash-back. 
To ensure that our interventions generate economic value and are sustainable over long time horizons, we have determined the mortality savings of the offerings had they been implemented 20 years ago and explored the profitability and economic value of the two T20 offerings over the next 20 years, and the WL offering across 20-year, 40-year and 60-year time horizons. Additionally, extensive stress testing on a few of our key assumptions has been performed and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and ethical considerations have been made, to ensure that our offerings continue to align with SuperLife’s primary goals during adverse scenarios.

### Program Design
![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165624001/318cbf50-6d1a-45f8-b5d8-a8a3f093549f)

Program Design describes the three program bundles' features and requirements (as seen in the Flow Chart above), justified through their contribution towards a decrease in expected mortality and an increase in program participation. Additionally, it defines and justifies the 5-year short-term and 20, 40 and 60-year long-term timeframes to evaluate the program.

### Pricing and Costs
Pricing and costs covers the mortality savings if our policy bundles were implemented over the past 20 years. It also projects the expected economic value added over suitable timeframes such as 20, 40 and 60-year for whole life and 20-year for our term life products. We also determine possible pricing adjustments, focusing mainly on premium reductions. 

### Assumptions
There were a range of key assumptions made by our team, including data assumptions, program design assumptions, pricing and cost assumptiuons, lapse rate assumptions, reserves assumptions, mortality assumptions, market rate assumptions, and other miscellaneous assumptions (see below).

### Risk and Mitigation
There are several considerable risks shown in the matrix below that factor into the Lumaria incentive program. Sensitivity on pricing parameters, interest rate and variable expenses show that our 3 programs are mostly profitable, with threats only on the extremities of our analysis. The Whole Life program performed best whereas the T20 Smoker program was the least financially stable.

### Data Limitations
The approximate per capita cost is not standardised to annual cost and external research was used to make assumptions on the frequency of each intervention. Further, individuals aged 56+ are significantly understated (9.98%) in the inforce dataset, compared to the encyclopedia (20.69%) in the 25-65 age bracket. We also see that 100% of the smokers aged 56+ have a claim (ie, all die), whereas only 4% of the non-smokers have a claim. This is significantly different. Overall, this will make pricing challenging as we observe an aging population in Lumaria but don't have enough data to support appropriate modeling for those ages. It was also found that inflation rate was higher than the interest rate in the given economic data, which implies a negative real rate. We removed specific outliers to get more stable results and a positive real interest rate. The provided data also doesn't provide any information regarding premium and salary of policyholders, as well as expense and commission rates. Again, assumptions were made for each of these variables which directly relate to profitability and hence will result in a degree of error in the overall profit and economic value added calculations.

### Pricing and Costs
Mortality Savings from Proposed Programs
Across the three proposed offerings, LCG has determined that there would have been immense savings from reduced mortality costs had the program been implemented for the past 20 years, as seen in Figure 4.  Appendix B1 outlines the process for determining mortality savings.
