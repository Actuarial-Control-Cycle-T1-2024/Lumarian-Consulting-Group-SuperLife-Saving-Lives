### Project Summary
Lumarian Consulting Group (LCG) presents a set of proposed life insurance and health incentive programs tailored for SuperLife's policyholders. These programs leverage data-driven insights and ethical considerations to incentivize healthy behaviours, reduce mortality rates, boost life insurance sales, enhance product competitiveness, and drive economic value for SuperLife.
Our proposal provides distinct life insurance offerings for a wide range of policyholders. For our 20-year term (T20) product, we introduce a smoking cessation program for eligible smokers under the age of 40, as well as, a general health screening intervention for eligible non-smokers under the age of 45. These programs have the incentive of reduced premiums upon engagement with the intervention. For our whole life (WL) product, we introduce a healthy heart screening intervention for eligible non-smokers over 45 with the incentive of a cash-back. 
To ensure that our interventions generate economic value and are sustainable over long time horizons, we have determined the mortality savings of the offerings had they been implemented 20 years ago and explored the profitability and economic value of the two T20 offerings over the next 20 years, and the WL offering across 20-year, 40-year and 60-year time horizons. Additionally, extensive stress testing on a few of our key assumptions has been performed and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and ethical considerations have been made, to ensure that our offerings continue to align with SuperLifeâ€™s primary goals during adverse scenarios.

### Program Design

Program Design describes the three program bundles' features and requirements (as seen in the Flow Chart above), justified through their contribution towards a decrease in expected mortality and an increase in program participation. Additionally, it defines and justifies the 5-year short-term and 20, 40 and 60-year long-term timeframes to evaluate the program.
### Pricing and Costs
Pricing and costs covers the mortality savings if our policy bundles were implemented over the past 20 years. It also projects the expected economic value added over suitable timeframes such as 20, 40 and 60-year for whole life and 20-year for our term life products. We also determine possible pricing adjustments, focusing mainly on premium reductions. 
### Assumptions

### Risk and Mitigation
There are several considerable risks shown in the matrix below that factor into the Lumaria incentive program. Sensitivity on pricing parameters, interest rate and variable expenses show that our 3 programs are mostly profitable, with threats only on the extremities of our analysis. The Whole Life program performed best whereas the T20 Smoker program was the least financially stable.
