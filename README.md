# Project Flow - Case Story
![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165624001/a33c2615-5b0a-48b7-8686-f49ca1daf808)

### Stage 1: Understand Project Summary
To start off, it was essential for our team, LCG, to understand the requirements and project details put forward by SuperLife to construct a health incentive program. This understanding drove effective consultation concerning SuperLife's primary goals and objectives.
### Stage 2: Data Investigation and External Research
The next stage of our project flow focused on understanding the data provided by SuperLife and filling in the gaps of the internal data with our external research. Our internal research focused on mortality experience, customer demographics and other insights discussed in the report. Our external research focused mainly on the efficacy and costs of the intervention programs and incentive recommendations.
### Stage 3: Intervention and Incentive Selection
Utilising our external research and growth opportunities determined through our understanding of the demographics, we determined the main intervention programs and incentive selections that would provide the greatest health benefits and economic values for Superlife and Lumaria. Resulting in the intervention program choices of smoking cessation, general health screening and healthy heart screening, suitable insurance types and incentives were determined to maximise a decrease in expected mortality and an increase in program participation.
### Stage 4: Establish Data Assumptions and Limitations
Before beginning the pricing, it was important to determine the data assumptions and limitations associated with our pricing model as well as the overall insights to maximise transparency and accuracy. There were a range of key assumptions made by our team, including data assumptions, program design assumptions, pricing and cost assumptions, lapse rate assumptions, reserves assumptions, mortality assumptions, market rate assumptions, and other miscellaneous assumptions. Similarly, data limitations covered the intervention program, internal and external data, and economic data.
### Stage 5: Pricing - Profits and Scenario Analysis
This stage adjusted the template pricing model to reflect our limitations and intervention incentives found from internal and external research. Macros was formulated to provide results for all age groups and policy types which was leveraged for a stronger sensitivity analysis. Our model found that pricing and costs covered the mortality savings if our policy bundles were implemented over the past 20 years. It also projects the expected economic value added over suitable timeframes such as 20, 40 and 60-year for whole life and 20-year for our term life products. We also determine possible pricing adjustments, focusing mainly on premium reductions.
### Stage 6: Risk and Risk Mitigations
Combining ongoing risk identification and categorising these under RCD guide, we outlined key mitigation approaches against selected risks for company consideration. Several considerable risks were considered for SuperLife's incentive program in a constructed risk matrix including intervention parameter errors, rate fluctuation, moral hazard and regional disparity. A sensitivity analysis on pricing parameters, interest rate and variable expenses showed that our three programs are mostly profitable, with threats only on the extremities of our analysis. 
### Stage 7: Final Recommendations
This constructed the rationale for our product solution for SuperLife from the synthesis of prior components.

# Project Summary
Lumarian Consulting Group (LCG) presents a set of proposed life insurance and health incentive programs tailored for SuperLife's policyholders. These programs leverage data-driven insights and ethical considerations to incentivize healthy behaviours, reduce mortality rates, boost life insurance sales, enhance product competitiveness, and drive economic value for SuperLife.
Our proposal provides distinct life insurance offerings for a wide range of policyholders. For our 20-year term (T20) product, we introduce a smoking cessation program for eligible smokers under the age of 40, as well as, a general health screening intervention for eligible non-smokers under the age of 45. These programs have the incentive of reduced premiums upon engagement with the intervention. For our whole life (WL) product, we introduce a healthy heart screening intervention for eligible non-smokers over 45 with the incentive of a cash-back. 
To ensure that our interventions generate economic value and are sustainable over long time horizons, we have determined the mortality savings of the offerings had they been implemented 20 years ago and explored the profitability and economic value of the two T20 offerings over the next 20 years, and the WL offering across 20-year, 40-year and 60-year time horizons. Additionally, extensive stress testing on a few of our key assumptions has been performed and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and ethical considerations have been made, to ensure that our offerings continue to align with SuperLife’s primary goals during adverse scenarios.

### Program Design
![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165624001/318cbf50-6d1a-45f8-b5d8-a8a3f093549f)

Program Design describes the three program bundles' features and requirements (as seen in the Flow Chart above), justified through their contribution towards a decrease in expected mortality and an increase in program participation. Additionally, it defines and justifies the 5-year short-term and 20, 40 and 60-year long-term timeframes to evaluate the program.

### Pricing and Costs
Mortality Savings from Proposed Programs
Across the three proposed offerings, LCG has determined that there would have been immense savings from reduced mortality costs had the program been implemented for the past 20 years, as seen in Figure 4.  Appendix B1 outlines the process for determining mortality savings.

<img width="462" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165342036/dd035e06-0a4f-46d2-9751-b8ca040e6099">

Figure 4: SuperLife’s Mortality Savings If The Program Had Been Implemented 20 Years Ago

T20 Smoker Bundle: Our T20 Smoker Package would have provided over Č15m, or 18.48%, in mortality savings, as seen in Figure 4. These large savings are due to the immense mortality improvements seen in younger individuals who successfully quit smoking. Indeed, we see that the mortality improvements through ages are variable (see Appendix B3). It is important to note that the variability in savings at issue ages are a result of many factors such as the variability in actual mortality experience when compared to expected mortality experience or modelling errors. It is important to consider this limitation within the context of the pricing section.

T20 Non-Smoker Bundle: Our T20 Non-Smoker Package would have provided over Č88m, or 17.01%, in mortality savings (see Figure 4). The mortality savings are evenly distributed over all age groups with slight variabilities at older age groups due to deviations from expected mortality improvements (see Appendix B4).

SPWL Non-Smoker Bundle: For the Whole Life Non-Smoker Package, we estimate total mortality savings of over Č22m, or 12.12%, as depicted in Figure 4. Similar to the T20 Non-Smoker Package, the mortality savings are fairly evenly distributed over all age groups with slight deviations due to the variability of actual mortality experience in relation to the expected mortality experience (see Appendix B5).

#### Economic Value Added From Proposed Program
When determining the added economic value of our proposed programs, our team projected sample portfolios of new sales in the year 2025 that follows the same composition of policies at each issue age as the overall book over the past 20 years (see Appendix B2). Added economic value from our bundles is calculated by the difference between the net present value of the portfolio with our proposed program and the net present value of the portfolio without the program. This portfolio of new sales is projected over suitable time frames such as 20 years for 20-year term policies and 20, 40 and 60 years for whole life policies.

<img width="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165342036/b912393d-a256-4e55-bbd8-78bc9233dca8">

Figure 5: SuperLife’s Economic Value Added Over Appropriate Timelines

T20 Non-Smoker Bundle: Over a 20-year timeline, our T20 bundle with the preventative screening program has an added economic value of 7.62%, equivalent to over Č14,000 for every 100 policy bundles sold. Each issue age of our portfolio provides added economic value with the largest increases occurring at younger ages due to a smaller premium reduction at ages under 30. However, after ages 30, the added economic value increases from 4% at issue age 31 to 7.3% at issue age 45, demonstrating the improved profitability for older ages (see Appendix B6). 

T20 Smoker Bundle: Over a 20-year time horizon, our T20 bundle with the smoking cessation program has an added economic value of 13.38%, equivalent to over Č80,000 for every 100 policy bundles sold. The largest increases in economic value occur at older ages of each premium reduction segment. For example, for the premium reduction of 2% between ages 25-30, the largest added economic value occurs at age 30. This is the same for ages 31-35 and ages 36-40, in line with our expectations (see Appendix B7).

SPWL Non-Smoker Bundle: For our whole life policy bundle, we projected our sample portfolio over 3 different time frames, that is, 20-year, 40-year and 60-year. Over a 20-year period, our initial portfolio has a 0.40% added economic value, with ages less than 55 having lost economic value, due to the cost benefits of mortality reductions not yet exceeding the intervention expenses and cash-backs, and ages greater than 55 having small added economic value. However, after a 40-year projection, we see an added economic value of 5.92%, with all age issue segments being profitable. Over the 60-year projection, our model suggests that the program provides 5.08% of added economic value. Over both 40 and 60-years, our projections indicate that issue ages 50-65 will be the most profitable (see Appendix B8).

#### Pricing Strategy: Proposed Pricing Changes
Given the characteristics of our policyholders relative to the wider Lumarian population, as well as, our own projections for Lumaria’s population, as seen in Appendix C2, we have introduced a range of pricing changes that aim to create the most economic value for Lumaria, whilst still maintaining ethical decision making. Indeed, the premium discounts we provide to those that engage with the smoking cessation program depend on the age of the policyholder as covered in program design, with those under the age of 30 receiving a 2% discount, those under the age of 35 a 5% discount, and those under the age of 40 an 8% discount.  Similarly, the premium discounts we provide to those that engage with the preventative screening program depend on the age of the policyholder, with those under the age of 30 receiving a 3% discount and those under the age of 45 receiving a 5% premium discount.  Individuals engaging with the heart screening program are provided with a 1.5% premium discount to their lump sum whole life premium paid at the beginning of the policy. 
Our pricing model projecting these pricing changes over suitable timeframes indicates increases in profitability despite reductions in premium and cash-back schemes. Thus, the proposed pricing changes optimize sales through added financial incentives and improve the profitability of policies on a per policy and aggregate basis. Furthermore, premium reductions to incentivize healthy behaviours and ultimately lower mortality whilst adding economic value reflects LCG and SuperLife’s focus to consider ethical objectives beyond just profit maximization. 
 

### Assumptions
There were a range of key assumptions made by our team, including data assumptions, program design assumptions, pricing and cost assumptiuons, lapse rate assumptions, reserves assumptions, mortality assumptions, market rate assumptions, and other miscellaneous assumptions (see below).

### Risk and Mitigation
Outlined below is a Risk Categorization and Definition (RCD) analysis that explores the main risks to be considered in both implementation and maintenance phases. 

![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/eefa7dcb-afb6-433f-b4a6-4792f5b2735a)

Risk Matrix
The most significant of these risks are shown in the corresponding risk matrix seen in Figure 8. These are pivotal factors in variables of likelihood and severity that will need ongoing monitoring to ensure continual program effectiveness and improvement.

### Data Limitations
The approximate per capita cost is not standardised to annual cost and external research was used to make assumptions on the frequency of each intervention. Further, individuals aged 56+ are significantly understated (9.98%) in the inforce dataset, compared to the encyclopedia (20.69%) in the 25-65 age bracket. We also see that 100% of the smokers aged 56+ have a claim (ie, all die), whereas only 4% of the non-smokers have a claim. This is significantly different. Overall, this will make pricing challenging as we observe an aging population in Lumaria but don't have enough data to support appropriate modeling for those ages. It was also found that inflation rate was higher than the interest rate in the given economic data, which implies a negative real rate. We removed specific outliers to get more stable results and a positive real interest rate. The provided data also doesn't provide any information regarding premium and salary of policyholders, as well as expense and commission rates. Again, assumptions were made for each of these variables which directly relate to profitability and hence will result in a degree of error in the overall profit and economic value added calculations.
