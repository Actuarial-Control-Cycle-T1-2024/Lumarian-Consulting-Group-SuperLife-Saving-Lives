# Project Flow - Case Story

### Stage 1: Understand Project Summary
To start off, it was essential for our team, LCG, to understand the requirements and project details put forward by SuperLife to construct a health incentive program. This understanding drove effective consultation concerning SuperLife's primary goals and objectives.
### Stage 2: Data Investigation and External Research
The next stage of our project flow focused on understanding the data provided by SuperLife and filling in the gaps of the internal data with our external research. Our internal research focused on mortality experience, customer demographics and other insights discussed in the report. Our external research focused mainly on the efficacy and costs of the intervention programs and incentive recommendations.
### Stage 3: Intervention and Incentive Selection
Utilising our external research and growth opportunities determined through our understanding of the demographics, we determined the main intervention programs and incentive selections that would provide the greatest health benefits and economic values for Superlife and Lumaria. Resulting in the intervention program choices of smoking cessation, general health screening and healthy heart screening, suitable insurance types and incentives were determined to maximise a decrease in expected mortality and an increase in program participation.
### Stage 4: Establish Data Assumptions and Limitations
Before beginning the pricing, it was important to determine the data assumptions and limitations associated with our pricing model as well as the overall insights to maximise transparency and accuracy. There were a range of key assumptions made by our team, including data assumptions, program design assumptions, pricing and cost assumptions, lapse rate assumptions, reserves assumptions, mortality assumptions, market rate assumptions, and other miscellaneous assumptions. Similarly, data limitations covered the intervention program, internal and external data, and economic data.
### Stage 5: Pricing - Profits and Scenario Analysis
This stage adjusted the template pricing model to reflect our limitations and intervention incentives found from internal and external research. Macros was formulated to provide results for all age groups and policy types which was leveraged for a stronger sensitivity analysis. Our model found that pricing and costs covered the mortality savings if our policy bundles were implemented over the past 20 years. It also projects the expected economic value added over suitable timeframes such as 20, 40 and 60-year for whole life and 20-year for our term life products. We also determine possible pricing adjustments, focusing mainly on premium reductions.
### Stage 6: Risk and Risk Mitigations
Combining ongoing risk identification and categorising these under RCD guide, we outlined key mitigation approaches against selected risks for company consideration. Several considerable risks were considered for SuperLife's incentive program in a constructed risk matrix including intervention parameter errors, rate fluctuation, moral hazard and regional disparity. A sensitivity analysis on pricing parameters, interest rate and variable expenses showed that our three programs are mostly profitable, with threats only on the extremities of our analysis. 
### Stage 7: Final Recommendations
This constructed the rationale for our product solution for SuperLife from the synthesis of prior components.

# Project Summary
Lumarian Consulting Group (LCG) presents a set of proposed life insurance and health incentive programs tailored for SuperLife's policyholders. These programs leverage data-driven insights and ethical considerations to incentivize healthy behaviours, reduce mortality rates, boost life insurance sales, enhance product competitiveness, and drive economic value for SuperLife.
Our proposal provides distinct life insurance offerings for a wide range of policyholders. For our 20-year term (T20) product, we introduce a smoking cessation program for eligible smokers under the age of 40, as well as, a general health screening intervention for eligible non-smokers under the age of 45. These programs have the incentive of reduced premiums upon engagement with the intervention. For our whole life (WL) product, we introduce a healthy heart screening intervention for eligible non-smokers over 45 with the incentive of a cash-back. 
To ensure that our interventions generate economic value and are sustainable over long time horizons, we have determined the mortality savings of the offerings had they been implemented 20 years ago and explored the profitability and economic value of the two T20 offerings over the next 20 years, and the WL offering across 20-year, 40-year and 60-year time horizons. Additionally, extensive stress testing on a few of our key assumptions has been performed and comprehensive risk mitigation strategies and ethical considerations have been made, to ensure that our offerings continue to align with SuperLife’s primary goals during adverse scenarios.

# Report
### Program Design
Figure 1 details the decision flows that dictate which consumer demographic aligns with one of three specific bundled products which includes the intervention, incentivization program, policy type and face value. Depending on the characteristics of the policyholder, such as age and smoking status, they may be eligible for one of the three bundles. The subsequent section outlines each program, their incentives for participation, key features and evaluation timelines.

![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165624001/318cbf50-6d1a-45f8-b5d8-a8a3f093549f)

Figure 1: SuperLife’s Health Program Bundles

#### 20 Year Term Life Insurance with Smoking Cessation Program 
This product bundle will be issued to smokers 40 years old or younger with a smoking cessation program and a 20-year term life insurance product of Č1m sum insured. The smoking cessation program will provide participants with resources, including support groups. The program’s average mortality can be reduced by 46.26% given the smoker quits (see Appendix A1). 

LCG has identified smokers as a key underrepresented demographic, given smokers comprise only 6.3% of SuperLife’s policies compared to 18% of Lumaria’s population, with this number falling to just 3.8% for policies written in the last five years, as seen in Figure 2. This presents an opportunity to greatly improve health outcomes, reduce mortality and add economic value. For this reason, smokers under the age of 40 who purchase a policy with a sum insured of Č1m, will be eligible to participate in a smoking cessation program. Due to the observed increase in mortality for smokers after age 40 within our in-force data, as well as, empirical evidence demonstrating that smoking cessation at ages below 40 have a mortality reduction of up to 90% of the excess risk from smoking (Thomson et al. 2022) and smokers aged below 40 have higher attempt and success rates of quitting (Kim. Y, Lee. J & Cho. W, 2021) participants must be aged under 40 to be eligible. However, due to the high upfront costs associated with the program (see Appendix A2), a face value of Č1m is required to be eligible for the program.

Figure 2: Proportion Of Smokers For SuperLife’s In-force Policies And The General Population

To incentivize program participation, LCG recommends introducing premium reductions to policyholders who participate in the program, whereby policyholders under the age of 30 will be given a 2% discount, policyholders between the ages of 30-34 a 5% discount, and policyholders between the ages of 35-40 an 8% discount. These premium discounts are targeted incentives that encourage policyholders to engage with healthy behaviours that otherwise would not be recognized in pricing decisions. LCG recommends premium reductions over alternate incentives due to ease of implementation, low operational costs, clear and direct relationship in encouraging program participation and high confidence in projecting economic value added. The size of the eligible discount increasing with age has been decided according to our goal of increasing the sales and competitiveness of SuperLife’s life insurance offerings, given the higher profitability at ages 30-40 had these stepped reductions not been implemented (see Appendix B), as well as, our expectation of Lumaria’s population to age (see Appendix C4). 

#### 20 Year Term Life Insurance with General Health Screening Program 
Our proposed T20 life insurance offering for non-smokers under 45 includes the general health screening intervention with a sum insured of Č500,000. This non-specific health intervention acts as a preventative measure to reduce mortality of otherwise healthy individuals. As with our other T20 life program, reduced premiums will act as an incentive to encourage participation with the condition of engaging with the preventative screening every two years.

With a program catered to young smokers established, another program catered for young non-smokers would diversify the target markets. External research into incentives for preventative screening found estimates of 23% reductions in mortality rates, demonstrating a reduction greater than the 5-10% range provided in our intervention data, and resulting in our conservative expected mortality reduction of 8% (McCracken et al., 2024). Due to the upfront costs of this measure, policyholders will be required to have a face value of Č500,000 to be eligible. 

Similar to our T20 Smoker offering, policyholders who engage with this program will be eligible for premium reductions. Those aged 30 or under are eligible for a 3% premium reduction, and those aged between 31-45, 5%. This rewards healthy behaviours that would otherwise not be priced into life insurance products, with the size of this reduction being consistent with the profitability and competitiveness of the product. 

#### Whole Life Insurance with Heart Health Screening 
Our proposed WL insurance offering would be aimed at non-smokers older than 45 through a heart screening program with a sum insured of Č100,000. The program consists of regular screenings for cholesterol levels and blood pressure, with cash-backs incentives conditional on program engagement every two years.

In-force policy data shows 31.30% of deaths amongst policyholders occurring due to heart-related issues (see Figure 3), with these deaths being more common among WL policyholders (see Appendix A3). Moreover, research found that heart-screening initiatives were especially recommended for those over 45. (Department of Health and Aged Care, 2023). Further external research found an 11% reduction in all-cause mortality from just cardiovascular screenings (Lindholt et al., 2023). Hence, LCG adopted a conservative expected mortality reduction of 8%.

As the upfront costs of this offering are not as high as the T20 offerings, this product will be available to those with a sum insured of Č100,000 to target lower socioeconomic individuals with a lower upfront premium for WL insurance. Policyholders who participate with the program will be awarded a 
cash-back of 2% of the initial lump sum premium upon death. This is to incentivize healthy preventative measures that induce mortality reductions.

Figure 3: Cause of Death Among In-force Policyholders

#### Other Program Features
In addition to the program features designed to encourage policyholders to participate in programs that induce mortality reduction, LCG has proposed a range of measures to ensure the competitiveness and marketability of these life insurance offerings.

Entitled Issue Ages: We recommend a restriction on entitled issue ages to individuals aged 26 to 65. This assumption was established from SuperLife’s in-force data only pertaining to issue ages ranging from 26 to 65. Furthermore, programs would be less effective at reducing mortality and risk not being profitable outside of these ranges. 

Distribution Channels: The popular distribution channels for each policy type is an essential consideration in maximizing product competitiveness and marketability. Appendix A4 shows the distribution channel for each insurance product expected as percentage of sales. We recommend an increase in online marketing for all three products, particularly T20 products, due to the increase in online sales in the last five years to 49.8% of all policies (see Appendix A4). Additionally, we recommend that SuperLife trains agents to convey the benefits of their WL insurance offerings, as it continues to be the most popular distribution channel for WL. 

#### Evaluation of the Program
Our short-term and long-term timeframes for evaluating the program have been formulated based on SuperLife’s primary goals, as well as any potential risks and ethical considerations. 

Our short-term timeframe aims to address the primary goals of encouraging healthy behaviours, boosting life insurance sales and improving product competitiveness, as well as key risks that we have identified (see Figure 8), whereas the long-term timeframe aims to address SuperLife’s goals of reducing mortality and adding economic value, and reassesses the key risks that we have identified.   A five-year horizon was chosen to have enough data and experience to draw accurate conclusions without the risk of investing heavily into a program that doesn’t align with our objectives.  

The short-term time frame ensures that the program which achieves SuperLife’s objectives of incentivizing healthy behaviours, is a differentiated life insurance offering within the Lumarian life insurance market that is marketed well and is profitable and financially feasible for the remainder of the program. Additionally, the key risks and ethical issues that LCG have identified for this program will be assessed, and corresponding risk mitigation measures will be implemented if necessary. As this is a key time to ensure successful implementation of the proposed life insurance offerings, monthly monitoring of new business and in-force claims will be done, with appropriate pricing adjustments made if necessary. Additionally, to ensure that SuperLife administers these interventions and incentives in a transparent manner, quarterly policyholder surveys will be conducted, as well as a platform where policyholders can share their feedback at any point in time.

Beyond this short-term horizon, the objectives of reducing mortality and adding economic value to SuperLife will also be assessed. Added economic value determined by our pricing models over 20-year, 40-year and 60-year time horizons will be monitored on an annual basis, with premium adjustments (i.e. revision of premium reductions and cash-backs) made if necessary. To ensure the continued success and sustainability of the proposed life insurance offerings, quarterly monitoring of new business and in-force claims will be done, with appropriate pricing adjustments made if necessary. Furthermore, risks and ethical considerations will be regularly reviewed and corresponding mitigation strategies will be actioned where appropriate. To ensure that SuperLife continues to remain ethical in their operations, the quarterly policyholder surveys and feedback platforms will continue to be maintained and monitored. 
### Pricing and Costs
Mortality Savings from Proposed Programs
Across the three proposed offerings, LCG has determined that there would have been immense savings from reduced mortality costs had the program been implemented for the past 20 years, as seen in Figure 4.  Appendix B1 outlines the process for determining mortality savings.

<img width="462" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165342036/dd035e06-0a4f-46d2-9751-b8ca040e6099">

Figure 4: SuperLife’s Mortality Savings If The Program Had Been Implemented 20 Years Ago

T20 Smoker Bundle: Our T20 Smoker Package would have provided over Č15m, or 18.48%, in mortality savings, as seen in Figure 4. These large savings are due to the immense mortality improvements seen in younger individuals who successfully quit smoking. Indeed, we see that the mortality improvements through ages are variable (see Appendix B3). It is important to note that the variability in savings at issue ages are a result of many factors such as the variability in actual mortality experience when compared to expected mortality experience or modelling errors. It is important to consider this limitation within the context of the pricing section.

T20 Non-Smoker Bundle: Our T20 Non-Smoker Package would have provided over Č88m, or 17.01%, in mortality savings (see Figure 4). The mortality savings are evenly distributed over all age groups with slight variabilities at older age groups due to deviations from expected mortality improvements (see Appendix B4).

SPWL Non-Smoker Bundle: For the Whole Life Non-Smoker Package, we estimate total mortality savings of over Č22m, or 12.12%, as depicted in Figure 4. Similar to the T20 Non-Smoker Package, the mortality savings are fairly evenly distributed over all age groups with slight deviations due to the variability of actual mortality experience in relation to the expected mortality experience (see Appendix B5).

#### Economic Value Added From Proposed Program
When determining the added economic value of our proposed programs, our team projected sample portfolios of new sales in the year 2025 that follows the same composition of policies at each issue age as the overall book over the past 20 years (see Appendix B2). Added economic value from our bundles is calculated by the difference between the net present value of the portfolio with our proposed program and the net present value of the portfolio without the program. This portfolio of new sales is projected over suitable time frames such as 20 years for 20-year term policies and 20, 40 and 60 years for whole life policies.

<img width="452" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165342036/b912393d-a256-4e55-bbd8-78bc9233dca8">

Figure 5: SuperLife’s Economic Value Added Over Appropriate Timelines

T20 Non-Smoker Bundle: Over a 20-year timeline, our T20 bundle with the preventative screening program has an added economic value of 7.62%, equivalent to over Č14,000 for every 100 policy bundles sold. Each issue age of our portfolio provides added economic value with the largest increases occurring at younger ages due to a smaller premium reduction at ages under 30. However, after ages 30, the added economic value increases from 4% at issue age 31 to 7.3% at issue age 45, demonstrating the improved profitability for older ages (see Appendix B6). 

T20 Smoker Bundle: Over a 20-year time horizon, our T20 bundle with the smoking cessation program has an added economic value of 13.38%, equivalent to over Č80,000 for every 100 policy bundles sold. The largest increases in economic value occur at older ages of each premium reduction segment. For example, for the premium reduction of 2% between ages 25-30, the largest added economic value occurs at age 30. This is the same for ages 31-35 and ages 36-40, in line with our expectations (see Appendix B7).

SPWL Non-Smoker Bundle: For our whole life policy bundle, we projected our sample portfolio over 3 different time frames, that is, 20-year, 40-year and 60-year. Over a 20-year period, our initial portfolio has a 0.40% added economic value, with ages less than 55 having lost economic value, due to the cost benefits of mortality reductions not yet exceeding the intervention expenses and cash-backs, and ages greater than 55 having small added economic value. However, after a 40-year projection, we see an added economic value of 5.92%, with all age issue segments being profitable. Over the 60-year projection, our model suggests that the program provides 5.08% of added economic value. Over both 40 and 60-years, our projections indicate that issue ages 50-65 will be the most profitable (see Appendix B8).

#### Pricing Strategy: Proposed Pricing Changes
Given the characteristics of our policyholders relative to the wider Lumarian population, as well as, our own projections for Lumaria’s population, as seen in Appendix C2, we have introduced a range of pricing changes that aim to create the most economic value for Lumaria, whilst still maintaining ethical decision making. Indeed, the premium discounts we provide to those that engage with the smoking cessation program depend on the age of the policyholder as covered in program design, with those under the age of 30 receiving a 2% discount, those under the age of 35 a 5% discount, and those under the age of 40 an 8% discount.  Similarly, the premium discounts we provide to those that engage with the preventative screening program depend on the age of the policyholder, with those under the age of 30 receiving a 3% discount and those under the age of 45 receiving a 5% premium discount.  Individuals engaging with the heart screening program are provided with a 1.5% premium discount to their lump sum whole life premium paid at the beginning of the policy. 
Our pricing model projecting these pricing changes over suitable timeframes indicates increases in profitability despite reductions in premium and cash-back schemes. Thus, the proposed pricing changes optimize sales through added financial incentives and improve the profitability of policies on a per policy and aggregate basis. Furthermore, premium reductions to incentivize healthy behaviours and ultimately lower mortality whilst adding economic value reflects LCG and SuperLife’s focus to consider ethical objectives beyond just profit maximization. 
 

### Assumptions
There were a range of key assumptions made by our team, including data assumptions, program design assumptions, pricing and cost assumptiuons, lapse rate assumptions, reserves assumptions, mortality assumptions, market rate assumptions, and other miscellaneous assumptions (see below).

![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/group-page-showcase-lumarian-consulting-group/assets/165624001/bb4a08d5-3628-4285-90ba-b8b9bc0c098e)

### Risk and Mitigation
Outlined below is a Risk Categorization and Definition (RCD) analysis that explores the main risks to be considered in both implementation and maintenance phases. 

![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/eefa7dcb-afb6-433f-b4a6-4792f5b2735a)

#### Risk Matrix
The most significant of these risks are shown in the corresponding risk matrix seen in Figure 8. These are pivotal factors in variables of likelihood and severity that will need ongoing monitoring to ensure continual program effectiveness and improvement.

![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/33964998-d2b2-4828-a8f1-245fce40afef)

#### Sensitivity Analysis
Selected quantifiable risks of variable mortality reduction and intervention costs, implicit to our program design, were measured in sensitivity analysis to manage profitability forecasts. Sensitvity analysis leveraged the same
processes as seen in Appendix B2, but with different underlying assumptions.

![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/0da9a3ec-e48c-4111-b44a-2119e39b7656)

(Figures 9-11 - T20 Smoker)
The T20 Smokers Package is highly volatile to changes in mortality and intervention expense parameters and hence have less stable profits, as seen in Figure 9. The extremities of our parameters either reducing profitability by 19.32% or increasing profitability by 46.16%.  With investment rate and variable expense measures however, it is profitable across all measures (see Figures 10 and 11). Monitoring and control are required with this particular package with respect to parameter predictors and black swan events that cause drastic change.   

![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/8deaa1a7-9889-47c2-934a-e32e37ce7f33)
![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/b2caa0fe-130b-45da-8232-19aa1eb94b22)
![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/5c8ba281-5e6d-4a91-bf43-88065904b859)

(Figures 12-14 - T20 Non-Smoker) 
In comparison, non-smoker term contracts are more stable to changes in mortality and intervention expenses (see Figure 12). Variable expenses, however, have a more pronounced impact on profitability, as depicted in Figure 14 with losses on higher ranges.

![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/db881683-2a7a-4f72-ba58-acca7249f999)
![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/87a5ba49-2593-4f8e-ba05-e12224fcc504)
![image](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-T1-2024/Lumarian-Consulting-Group-SuperLife-Saving-Lives/assets/165276990/a1beb59c-836a-4009-948b-4694bc053a8f)

(Figures 15-17 - Whole Life)
As seen in Figures 15-17, the WL Non-Smoker Package has the most stable profits, with profits in nearly all simulated scenarios of intervention. Large increases to variable expense pose a large risk which will require mitigation techniques discussed above.
The sensitivity analysis suggests there is a strong degree of certainty that the WL Non-Smoker Program will increase profit in comparison to those without intervention. The T20 Non-Smoker Program is also almost certainly a beneficial program with only concerns in extremities of expense and mortality. The T20 Smoker Program is still beneficial, however, has greater profit
variability. The differential of the benefits is extended by our focus on different face value cases, where lower socio-economic classes face greater mortality improvements through healthcare programs and gives more assurance to our models. 

Empirical evidence from various studies indicates that our programs would have almost certainly reduced mortality over the past two decades. Notably, smoking cessation, particularly of ages below 35, has shown the most significant impact, by reducing relative mortality risk upwards of 50% in studies (Thomson et al., 2022)11. While effectiveness decreases on subsequent decades due to prior smoking exposure, there remains a notable impact of over 30%. Additionally, screenings have been associated with empirical estimates for mortality reduction, with regular preventative screenings at approximately 23% (McCracken et al., 2024)10 and cardiovascular screenings around 11% (Lindholt et al., 2023)7. Ultimately, against these measured results, our model takes more conservative parameters and increases the viability of its effectiveness over the last 20 years with adequate risk mitigation and monitoring. 

It is important to consider the ethical framework in delivering truthful and professional products to consumers and this, in conjunction with reputational outlook needs to be consistently monitored with ongoing data collected by Superlife after the introduction of proposed programs. Continual transparency with clients who undertake any of the three programs is paramount and accommodating these clients with their respective promised premium reductions alongside the overall initiative in ethical goals of improving general health and mortality levels needs to be ensured through mitigations over time. To ensure that SuperLife continues to remain ethical in their operations, we have suggested quarterly policyholder surveys, as well as, a platform for feedback at any time.


### Data Limitations
The approximate per capita cost is not standardised to annual cost and external research was used to make assumptions on the frequency of each intervention. Further, individuals aged 56+ are significantly understated (9.98%) in the inforce dataset, compared to the encyclopedia (20.69%) in the 25-65 age bracket. We also see that 100% of the smokers aged 56+ have a claim (ie, all die), whereas only 4% of the non-smokers have a claim. This is significantly different. Overall, this will make pricing challenging as we observe an aging population in Lumaria but don't have enough data to support appropriate modeling for those ages. It was also found that inflation rate was higher than the interest rate in the given economic data, which implies a negative real rate. We removed specific outliers to get more stable results and a positive real interest rate. The provided data also doesn't provide any information regarding premium and salary of policyholders, as well as expense and commission rates. Again, assumptions were made for each of these variables which directly relate to profitability and hence will result in a degree of error in the overall profit and economic value added calculations.
